# information-retrieval-news-sites
Using a sitemap scrappy spider we downloaded pages (html files) from one popular news site, processed the html files and created a xml inverted file. Thereafter we executed simple queries on the inverted file.

# Files:
  news_spider.py --> crawls the sitemap of BBC and downloads html files of news articles. </br>
  newsparser.py --> Parses the html files and extracts the title and the text of each article. </br>
  preprocess.py --> Creates the xml inverted index using the files generated by newsparser.py. It also removes stopword POS tags and stems the terms using the Porter Stemmer. Weight calculation is done based on term frequency.</br>
  retrival.py --> Retrieves articles based on some query keywords.
